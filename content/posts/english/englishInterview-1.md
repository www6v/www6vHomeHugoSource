+ 采取的行动：Because of her shy personality, I wanted to encourage her to have more confidence in her abilities. It was clear she was going to be good at her job, but I just needed to help her get over the initial anxiety of joining a new team that she was unfamiliar with.
+ By introducing her to all team members, and by being patient with her whilst going through company procedures and training, her confidence levels started to improve dramatically.
+ 永远的欢天喜地大结局：Within two weeks of joining, she was a fully trained up and confident member of the team who everyone valued. 


### Q17 Describe a time when the team you were a part of was undergoing some change. How did the change impact you, and how do you adapt?
+ In my previous job, a new manager came into the team and she wanted to make big changes to the way that we operated. This was a big thing for the team because the previous manager had not changed anything for many years.
+ I was quite excited about the change because I felt there were some things we could improve on. The change impacted me because I had to learn new skills and duties. Some members of the team were negative about the change, but I encouraged them to view it more positively and to see it as an opportunity for personal growth.
+ I adapted by being supportive of the change, by viewing it positively and by doing all I could to learn the new duties quickly and diligently. Change is a good thing and if you embrace it positive things can happen.
